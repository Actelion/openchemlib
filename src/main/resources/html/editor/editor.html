<H2>Chemical Editor Concepts</H2>
<p>The structure editor is used to draw chemical molecules, substructure fragments,
reactions and simple drawing objects like text, boxes, etc. Its functionality changes
depending on the kind of object(s) being edited. Thus, the atom mapping tool is only available,
when a reaction is edited. Query feature dialogs only open, when a substructure is edited, etc.</p>
<br>
<H3>Atom and Bond Hot-Keys</H3>
<p>Hot-keys allow to quickly change atoms and bonds or to attach common groups to an atom.
When the mouse pointer is moving near to an atom or bond then the atom or bond is automatically highlighted,
indicating that a mouse click or typing hot-keys will affect the highlighted atom or bond.</p>

<H3>Atom labels & Substituents & Protecting Groups</H3>
<p>While the mouse pointer is near an atom such that the atom is highlighted, you may type one or
multiple keys to change the atom label or to attach common substituent.
The sequence of typed keys is shown in the editor. If it is recognized to represent a valid atom label,
then the key string is shown in black. If it is recognized as a known substituent or protecting group name,
then it is shown in blue. The key string is shown in gray, if it can be extended by adding more keys to
a known group name. Finally, it is shown in red, if no valid completion to a known name is possible.
Once a black or blue color indicates that your key string is recognized, you may move the mouse away or type
<i>Enter</i> to actually convert the atom into the new type or to automatically attach the recognized
substituent.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience atom labels or group names can be typed using lower case letters only.
Dashes in group names may also be omitted. E.g. typing 'n' followed by 'a' converts the atom to a sodium atom
and typing 'otolyl' attaches an ortho-Tolyl group.</p>
<p>Known group names are: Ac, Alloc, Allyl, Am, Benzoyl, Benzyl, Boc, BOM, Bn, Bs, Bt, Btm, Bu, Bz,
Bzh, Bzl, BzOM, Cbz, Cy, cyclobutyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopropyl, Dan, DEAE, DEIPS,

PMB, PMBM, PNB, PPi, Ph, Phenyl, Pht, Piv, Poc, Pr, Pv, s-Am, s-Bu, s-Butyl, SEM, SES, t-Am, t-Bu, t-Butyl,
TBDMS, TBDPS, TBMPS, TBS, TDS, TFA, THF, THP, TIPS, TMS, Tf, Thexyl, Tos, Troc, Trt, Ts, Xyl.</p>
<p>To be compatible with ChemDraw, 'l' is recognized as chlorine atom. If you are editing a sub-structure,
you may use 'x' to convert an atom into an atom list containing all halogene atoms.</p>

<br>
<H3>Buttons and Tools</H3>
<p>Chemical structures are drawn by selecting an appropriate tool and applying it
while moving, clicking and dragging the mouse pointer over the drawing area. While the
selection of a tool has no immidiate effect on the drawn structure, pressing a button
does. Currently available buttons allow to clean up atom coordinates or to revert the
most recent structure change.</p>

while pressing the 'Ctrl'-key, then a dialog window open that allows to
specify an unusual/custom atom label, a specific isotop, an abnormal valence
and/or a radical state. When closing the dialog the clicked atom is changed
accordingly. The dialog settings are remembered and applied to any other clicked atom,

Editor</b> assumes the presence of implicit hydrogens at any charged or non
charged atoms to meet the atom's default valence. However, implicit hydrogens
are only shown on hetero atoms.</td>

or a spiro compound, respectively.</td>

  <td>Bond Tools</td>
  <td>Bond Tools allow you to create new bonds and to change existing bonds
concerning their order or stereo-orientation. By clicking into the open
space you create a new bond of the selected type including two carbon atoms.
Clicking onto an existing atom will attach a new carbon. Dragging the mouse from
one atom to another one will just connect these atoms or increment the bond order
between them, if they were already connected. If the plain single bond tool is
selected, bonds may be multiply clicked to cycle through the possible bond orders.
Where reasonable, it also toggles between double bonds with known or unknown
configuration, the so-called cross bond.
When using stereo bonds please consider that the pointed tip of the bond should
always point to the stereo center.</td>

Molecular Design Ltd. with IsisDraw V2.5. The ESR Tools allow to define for every
stereo center, whether it is an absolute one or if it belongs to a group of stereo
centers that have the drawn, but relative configuration. For any group of relative
stereo centers one may define that the drawn <b>and</b> the inverse configurations are present,
i.e. that we have a racemic situation concerning the group members. This is indicated by
green stereo bonds and an ampersand '<b>&</b>' at the stereo centers. Likewise one may
define groups of relative stereo centers that contain either the drawn configuration <b>or</b>
the opposite one. Stereo centers of such a group are indicated by blue stereo bonds and
the word '<b>or</b>' at the stereo centers. In addition to the '<b>&</b>' or '<b>or</b>'
indicators group numbers show which stereo centers belong to the same group.</td>

  <td><img src="lassoPointerTool.png" border="0"></td>
  <td>Lasso Pointer Tool</td>
  <td>This tools allows you to select multiple atoms and bonds to rearrange,
rotate, resize, delete or duplicate at the same time. Just drag the mouse pointer
around the atoms of interest. Selected atoms and bonds are shown in red. By pressing
the control key you switch to the rectangular selection mode and the shift key lets
you add atoms to the current selection. By clicking onto an atom or bonds and dragging
the mouse one may more it or all selected atoms, if the clicked one is selected.
When pressing the shift key while dragging a selected fragment, an automatically created
copy of the selected fragment is dragged.
Where the editor needs to support multiple molecules, e.g. if a reaction is edited,
then every reactant and product is indicated by a large light gray indicator in
the background ('A', 'B', 'P1', etc.). Where independent fragments shall be treated
as one molecule, e.g. anion and kation of one salt, one must locate those fragments
close enough that there is only one indicator behind them.
If a reaction or molecule query is edited, then one may double click an atom or
a set of selected atoms to open a query feature dialog to specify additional conditions
for a fragment to match in a substructure search. The same applies to individual or
multiple selected bonds. If the edited object is not a query then double clicking of
an atom or bond will just select the entire fragment.</td>

  <td>Mapping Tool</td>
  <td>This tool is only available when a reaction is edited. Use this tool to
associate any reactant atom to the same atom in the product. This is done by pressing
the mouse button on a reactant atom, dragging the mouse onto the corresponding product atom,
and releasing the mouse button there. The editor will acknowledge the link by displaying the
same red mapping number at both atoms. Afterward, if <i>Automatically Complete Mapping</i>
is selected, the editor tries to automatically map all remaining atoms of the reaction and
displays green numbers on all auto-mapped atoms. If the automatic mapping is correct, you may
make it persistent by selecting <i>Make Auto-Mapping Explicit</i> from the popup menu.
Individual atoms can be unmapped by just clicking on them. The auto-mapping, manual mapping,
or entire mapping can be removed from the reaction using the popup menu.<br>
DataWarrior's automatic mapping algorithm applies chemical knowledge together with
neighbourhood similarity. Often it is correct without specifying any explicitly (manually)
mapped atoms. If the auto-mapping is not correct, then you may map some key atoms manually,
until the remainder is auto-mapped correctly.
