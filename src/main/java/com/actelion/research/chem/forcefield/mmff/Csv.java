/**
 * Basic CSV parser. The Csv class provides very basic CSV file parsing
 * and assumes that CSV files are in a strict format. CSV files are
 * expected to conform to the following syntax:
 *
 *  - First line contains only the number of rows to be read as an
 *      integer.
 *
 *  - Second line is a strictly comma separated row of type strings, where
 *      each type string has no preceeding or following whitespace. An
 *      example of a type string would be:
 *
 *          int,int,float,char
 *
 *      This type string informs the parser that the rows of the table
 *      have four cells of which the first two are integers and the last
 *      two are floating point numbers. Only three type strings are
 *      supported: 'int', 'float' and 'char'.
 *
 *  - Third line and onwards. These are the table rows. They are expected
 *      to conform to the type format specified in the type line (line 2).
 *      As well as this all rows are expected to have length equal to the
 *      type row. Cells in each row are strictly comma separated and
 *      contain no whitespace. Each cell is expected to be in a format
 *      that Java can parse using parseInt() for integer types,
 *      parseDouble() for floating point types, and char data types are
 *      expected to be a single character optionally enclosed in single
 *      or double quotation marks. An example of several CSV rows which
 *      adhere to the previously given type row:
 *
 *          1,16,3.900,'A'
 *          1,17,2.700,'-'
 *          1,18,2.100,'B'
 *          2,19,4.500,'C'
 *          2,20,1.050,'-'
 *          2,21,0.150,'D'
