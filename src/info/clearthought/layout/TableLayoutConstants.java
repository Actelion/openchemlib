 *
 * I. Terms for redistribution of original source and binaries
 *
 * Redistribution and use of unmodified source and/or binaries are
 * permitted provided that the following condition is met:
 *
 * 1. Redistributions of original source code must retain the above
 *    copyright notice and license.  You are not required to redistribute
 *    the original source; you may choose to redistribute only the
 *    binaries.
 *
 * Basically, if you distribute unmodified source, you meet
 * automatically comply with the license with no additional effort on
 * your part.
 *
 * II. Terms for distribution of derived works via subclassing and/or
 *     composition.
 *
 * You may generate derived works by means of subclassing and/or
 * composition (e.g., the Adaptor Pattern), provided that the following
 * conditions are met:
 *
 * 1. Redistributions of original source code must retain the above
 *    copyright notice and license.  You are not required to redistribute
 *    the original source; you may choose to redistribute only the
 *    binaries.
 *
 * 2. The original software is not altered.
 *
 * 3. Derived works are not contained in the info.clearthought
 *    namespace/package or any subpackage of info.clearthought.
 *
 * 4. Derived works do not use the class or interface names from the
 *    info.clearthought... packages
 *
 * For example, you may define a class with the following full name:
 *    org.nameOfMyOrganization.layouts.RowMajorTableLayout
 *
 * However, you may not define a class with the either of the
 * following full names:
 *    info.clearthought.layout.RowMajorTableLayout
 *    org.nameOfMyOrganization.layouts.TableLayout
 *
 * III. Terms for redistribution of source modified via patch files.
 *
 * You may generate derived works by means of patch files provided
 * that the following conditions are met:
 *
 * 1. Redistributions of original source code must retain the above
 *    copyright notice and license.  You are not required to
 *    redistribute the original source; you may choose to redistribute
 *    only the binaries resulting from the patch files.
 *
 * 2. The original source files are not altered.  All alteration is
 *    done in patch files.
 *
 * 3. Derived works are not contained in the info.clearthought
 *    namespace/package or any subpackage of info.clearthought.  This
 *    means that your patch files must change the namespace/package
 *    for the derived work.  See section II for examples.
 *
 * 4. Derived works do not use the class or interface names from the
 *    info.clearthought... packages.  This means your patch files
 *    must change the names of the interfaces and classes they alter.
 *    See section II for examples.
 *
 * 5. Derived works must include the following disclaimer.
 *    "This work is derived from Clearthought's TableLayout,
 *     https://tablelayout.dev.java.net, by means of patch files
 *     rather than subclassing or composition.  Therefore, this work
 *     might not contain the latest fixes and features of TableLayout."
 *
 * IV. Terms for repackaging, transcoding, and compiling of binaries.
 *
 * You may do any of the following with the binaries of the
 * original software.
 *
 * 1. You may move binaries (.class files) from the original .jar file
 *    to your own .jar file.
 *
 * 2. You may move binaries from the original .jar file to other
 *    resource containing files, including but not limited to .zip,
 *    .gz, .tar, .dll, .exe files.
 *
 * 3. You may backend compile the binaries to any platform, including
 *    but not limited to Win32, Win64, MAC OS, Linux, Palm OS, any
 *    handheld or embedded platform.
 *
 * 4. You may transcribe the binaries to other virtual machine byte
 *    code protocols, including but not limited to .NET.
